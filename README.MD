# Keras Environment Setup Script

This bash script automates the process of setting up a virtual environment (either venv or conda) and installing Keras 3 with either PyTorch or TensorFlow as the backend. The script guides the user through the setup process and provides helpful prompts and error messages.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher installed on your system
- Bash shell environment

## Usage

1. Save the script to a file with a `.sh` extension (e.g., `setup_keras_env.sh`).
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is saved.
3. Make the script executable by running the following command:
`chmod +x setup.sh`
4. Run the script using the following command:
`./setup.sh`
5. Follow the prompts to select the virtual environment type (venv or conda), provide a name for the environment, and choose the backend framework (PyTorch or TensorFlow).
